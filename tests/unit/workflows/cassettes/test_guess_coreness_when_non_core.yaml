    body: !!python/unicode '{"abstract": "Particle beam cancer therapy was introduced
      by Robert R. Wilson in 1947 based on the advantageous                 depth
      dose profile of a particle beam in human-like targets (water) compared to X-rays
      or electrons. Heavy charged                 particles have a finite range in
      water and present a distinct peak of dose deposition at the end of their range.                 Early
      work in Berkeley concentrated on multiple ion species and revealed strong differences
      in effectiveness in                 terminating cancer cells for different ions
      and along the particle track. This can be expressed in terms of the                 relative
      biological effectiveness (RBE). The search for the \u201cideal particle\u201d
      was started and early on, exotic particles                 like pions and antiprotons
      entered the field. Enhancement in physical dose deposition near the end of range
      for                 antiprotons compared to protons was shown experimentally
      but no data for the relative biological effectiveness were                 available.
      In 2004 the AD-4/ACE collaboration set out to fill this gap. In a pilot experiment
      using a 50\u2005MeV antiproton                 beam we measured the ratio of
      cell termination between the Bragg peak and the entrance region (plateau), which
      can be                 expressed by the biological effective dose ratio (BEDR),
      showing an increase of cell killing capability of antiprotons                 compared
      to protons at identical energy by a factor of 4. This promising result led to
      a continuation of the AD-4/ACE                 campaign using higher energy
      antiprotons and adding absolute dosimetry capabilities, allowing the extraction
      of the RBE                 of antiprotons at any depth along the antiproton
      beam.", "title": "Relative Biological Effectiveness of Antiprotons the AD-4/ACE
      Experiment"}'
