      in the N=2\u22c6 gauge theory by using its description in string                 theory
      as a freely-acting orbifold. The latter is used to compute, using the worldsheet,
      the deformation of the Yang\u2013Mills                 action. In addition,
      we calculate the deformed instanton partition function, thus extending the results
      to the non-perturbative                 sector of the gauge theory. As we point
      out, the structure of the deformation is extremely similar to the \u03a9-deformation,
      therefore                 confirming the universality of the construction. Finally,
      we comment on the realisation of the mass deformation using physical                 vertex
      operators by exploiting the equivalence between Scherk\u2013Schwarz deformations
      and freely-acting orbifolds.", "title": "Instanton Corrections for m and \u03a9"}'
